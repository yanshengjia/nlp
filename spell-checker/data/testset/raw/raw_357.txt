Everything that humans hear is in the form of waves .Just as eyes see light waves in the form of colours,ears hear sound waves in the form of noises.Ears and eyes turn these different waves into signals that the brain can make sense of. Ears and the brain have an amazing ability to recognize particular sounds.For example,a mother often can tell when her baby is crying even if there are other crying babies in the same room.This is because the sound of her baby’s cry has special meaning to her and the brain has recorded its importance. The ability to recognize sounds improves with experiences.As the brain receives information in its memory.When the brain hears new sounds,it gives meaning to them based on the information already in the memory.This is why certain words or songs can make a person happy.Often it is not the words or songs themselves that cause this feeling.The sounds are connected to happy memories for that person. Another hearing process controlled by the brain is to decide where a sound is coming from.One ear is usually closer to the source of a sound than the other ear is.Sound waves are stronger when they reach the ear that is closer.They also reach the closer first.The brain recognizes these differences and uses them to decide the location of the source of the sound.
