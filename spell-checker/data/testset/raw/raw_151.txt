Dear Tom. Thanks for your letter. Do you want to know about my evening? Well, I usually get home from work at 6:00 p. m.. I cook dinner for my family—my parents, my sister and my brother. After dinner I usually watch TV, play computer games or play chess. I like playing chess because my father works in a chess club. I take a shower at around nine o'clock and then go to bed at around nine thirty. Sometimes I read some books because I can learn something about my work. How about your evening? Write to me soon, please. Best wishes, Victor
